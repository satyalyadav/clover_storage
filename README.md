# Clover - Cloud File Storage & Management

Clover is a cloud file storage and management web application. It is basically a lightweight clone of Google Drive. It is built using Next.js for the frontend and Appwrite for the backend and database. You can upload all kinds of files on the platform, preview them, and also share them with other users in your instance of the application. Hosted on Vercel.

Based on the tutorial by [JavaScript Mastery](https://github.com/JavaScript-Mastery-Pro/storage-management).

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js** - React framework with App Router

- **shadcn/ui** - Re-usable component library
- **Recharts** - Data visualization and charts
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Backend & Services

- **Appwrite** - Backend-as-a-Service for:
  - User authentication
  - Database management
  - File storage
  - Server-side operations

### Form Handling & Validation

- **React Hook Form** - Form state management
- **Zod** - Schema validation
- **@hookform/resolvers** - Form validation integration

### Additional Libraries

- **react-dropzone** - File upload handling
- **input-otp** - OTP input component
- **use-debounce** - Debouncing utilities
- **class-variance-authority** - Component variant management
- **clsx** & **tailwind-merge** - Conditional styling utilities

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (current LTS) and npm/yarn/pnpm/bun
- An **Appwrite** account (sign up at [appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io) or use self-hosted instance)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd clover
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 3. Set up Appwrite

#### Create an Appwrite Project

1. Go to your [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io) (or your self-hosted instance)
2. Create a new project
3. Note your **Project ID** and **API Endpoint**

#### Set up Authentication

1. In your Appwrite project, go to **Auth** → **Settings**
2. Enable **Email/Password** authentication
3. Configure email settings (SMTP) for OTP delivery

#### Create Database and Collections

1. Go to **Databases** → Create a new database
2. Note your **Database ID**

**Create Users Collection:**

- Collection ID: `users` (or your preferred name)
- Add the following attributes:
  - `fullName` (String, required)
  - `email` (String, required, unique)
  - `avatar` (String, required)
  - `accountId` (String, required)
- Set permissions: Allow users to read/write their own documents

**Create Files Collection:**

- Collection ID: `files` (or your preferred name)
- Add the following attributes:
  - `type` (String, required) - Values: "document", "image", "video", "audio", "other"
  - `name` (String, required)
  - `url` (String, required)
  - `extension` (String, required)
  - `size` (Integer, required)
  - `owner` (String, required) - User ID reference
  - `accountId` (String, required)
  - `users` (String[], required) - Array of email addresses for sharing
  - `bucketFileId` (String, required)
- Set permissions: Allow users to read/write their own documents and read shared files

#### Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** → Create a new bucket
2. Note your **Bucket ID**
3. Set bucket permissions:
   - **Create**: Authenticated users
   - **Read**: Authenticated users
   - **Update**: File owner
   - **Delete**: File owner
4. Configure file size limit (default: 50MB, can be adjusted in `constants/index.ts`)

#### Get API Keys

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Create a new API key with the following scopes:
   - `databases.read`
   - `databases.write`
   - `storage.read`
   - `storage.write`
   - `users.read`
3. Copy the **Secret Key** (you won't be able to see it again)

### 4. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
# or for self-hosted: http://your-appwrite-instance/v1

NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE=your_database_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_USERS_COLLECTION=users
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FILES_COLLECTION=files
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_BUCKET=your_bucket_id
NEXT_APPWRITE_KEY=your_secret_api_key
```

**Important:** Replace all placeholder values with your actual Appwrite configuration IDs.

### 5. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### 6. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deployment

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. Add all environment variables in **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Deploy!

**Important:** Make sure to add all environment variables from your `.env.local` file to your Vercel project settings.

### Other Deployment Options

You can also deploy to:

- **Netlify** - Similar process, add environment variables in site settings
- **Railway** - Supports Next.js out of the box
- **Docker** - Build and deploy using containers
- **Self-hosted** - Deploy to your own server

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
